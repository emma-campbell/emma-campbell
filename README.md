# Hello 👋

My name is Emma. I am a computer science student at the University of Rochester. I am always down for a good challenge, and open to experiences that teach me new content.

Here's what I am up to:
- 🏛 Computational Theory & Computer Organization
- 🌱 Building my Portfolio Website
- 🥅 Contribute to more Open-Source!
