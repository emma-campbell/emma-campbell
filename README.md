# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emma. I am a Software Engineer at [Hugo Health](https://hugo.health). I am always down for a good challenge, and open to experiences that teach me new content. I am currently working as a fullstack engineer, wearing multiple hats for both our frontend and backend team.

I graduated in May 2021 from the University of Rochester with a B.A in Computer Science, with a degree focus in Human-Computer Interaction. I am super excited to be working at Hugo, and making a difference in the way we approach healthcare IT.
